Data Visualization report for a project of Data Analysis : Ridrs of bikes in US using Ford GoBike system in 2019 by Nawaf alhajri The data:

Ford GoBike Dataset is data of a system people use it to take a trip via bikes. it contains many features and information such as the duration of trip and what is the start station of each trip and when it begun? location and Id of stations and bikes and more.



I've choosed this dataset for many reasons one of them is related to my country vision. We don't have sharing bikes systems like this but in future we may have at least one system. Especially when the Metro government project will be on the land, then we need some systems and services like this.

In this Visualization I tried to focus on the trip duration and what type of users are using this service more than other by binding these results with the days on the week to try get something interesting to write an insight or recommend tips for whom are interested to this services

Summary of findings: There was a lot more subscribers using the bike sharing system than casual customers overall, Obviously different usage patterns and riding habits are observed between the two types of riders. customers ride a lot over weekends  for leisure/touring purposes. Subscribers tended to have much shorter/quicker trips compared to customers which makes subscriber usage more efficient.
